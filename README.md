# Welcome to OData2Poco
**OData2Poco** is a code generation tool for generating plain-old CLR objects (POCO) from OData feeds. 
POCO classes can be used in a typed RESTful client OData services and code generation can be controlled by setting many options.

## What is news
Odata2Poco v4.3.1 is released with  new features implemented for request [#43](https://github.com/moh-hassan/odata2poco/issues/43): Enable code generation that support nullable reference type of c#8 by adding new option -B/--enable-nullable-reference.
- Allow reading remote metadata http(s) xml files.
- Moving Solution to .Net 6. 

## OData2Poco Packages
OData2Poco is available in three flavers:

- A Console tool: OData2Poco.CommandLine (a.k.a o2pgen).
- A .Net Core Global tool  **dotnet-o2pgen** support NET5.
- A class library: support NET5/netstandard2.0/net45/net461.

**Features of OData2Poco**
   
- Generate POCO classes corresponding to the Entities defined in the XML MetaData stored in OData Feeds.     
- Generation is based on the Metadata of the service stored on the  server/  EDMX xml files or xml string contents.
- Support http(s) with/without authentication. The Supported autherizations are: basic, token and Oauth2.
- Console CommandLine tool Support .NET 4.5 or higher.
- Class library Support NET5/netstandard2.0/net461/net45.
- Support Windows or Linux /OS fx (net core) 
- Packaged as a nuget package in three different packages:
 -  A Class library full framework/ netstandard2.0 /NET5 for programming.
 - A console CommandLine tool (one executable file o2pgen.exe)
 -  Global net core support NET5 (dotnet-o2pgen).
 -  Console tool o2pgen is published as a Chocolatey package. 
- Generating CSharp POCO classes. Other languages may be added in the near future based on the community needs.
- Convert Data type of EDMX to the corresponding CLR data types.
- Support Entites, complex data type, Collections  and navigation properties.
- Support OData service version V1..V4
- Code generation is controlled by setting different options: 
  - Add the following attributes:
        - Add Key Attributes.
        - Add Required Attributes to the properties. 
        - Add JsonProperty Attribute to the properties.
        - Add Table Attribute to the class.
        - Add DataMember Attribute to the properties and DataContract Attribute to the class.
        - Add display attribute to the properties.
        - Add ProtoMember to the properties and ProtoContract to the class to suport Proto Buffer.
        - Add user defined attribute for the properties.
        
   - Adding virtual modifier to the properties.
   - Convert name of properties to camelCase or PasCase
   - Add nullable datatypes, e.g. int?.
   - Generate (or not) navigation properties.
   - Generated class follows inheritance hierarchy of OData feed (unless switched-off).
   - Generated class can inherit from a common BaseClass/interface.
   - Define namespace to overwrite the namespace of the model.
   - Filter Entities.
   - Name Mapping  of Entities and properties using json file with regex support.
- Add primary key/mandatory comments to the properties of the class. 
- Rename class/properties that have a name match a c# reserved keyword.  
- Save metadata and generated code to a user defined file name.
- Support colored console windows /linux /OS fx.
- Support Microsoft.OData.Edm library version 7.5+ (OData v4).
- Support Microsoft.Data.Edm library (OData v1-v3).

 **Features added in V3.2.0:**

- New: Support Microsoft Digest authentication.
- New: Support Integrated Windows Authentication, enabling users to log in with their Windows credentials (Issue#19).
- New: Add jsonProperty(originalName) to properties that are renamed because its name is the same as its enclosing type.
- New: Show/hide model warning due to renaming properties/classes whose name is a reserved  keyword.
- New: Support abstract class.
- New: support complex type inheritance
- New: Add attribute [MaxLength] for max length of string/byte[] properties.
- Convert EDM.TIME in Odata v3 to TimeSpan.
- Support multi schema.
- Support multi containers in OData  v3.
